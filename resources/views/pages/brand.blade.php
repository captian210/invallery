              If there’s one thing that’s clear about SEO, it’s that the Google SERPs
              favor bring brands. Recognizable brands rank easier, enjoy better
              click-through rates, and are less likely to suffer from SEO penalties. 
            </p>
            <p class="pt-4">
              And with every new update to the Google algorithm, this preferential
              treatment only increases. That’s why it’s more important than ever for
              smaller companies to invest in building their brands—and Brand Links
              are the best way to do it

                      Social proof is a key ranking factor, and
                      brand links and mentions are an important
                      part of social proof. Google only wants to
                      rank the most naturally popular websites.
                      When the search engine spiders see people
                      talking about your brand, it builds search
                      engine trust and enhances your SEO.

                      This isn’t just about building links, it’s also
                      about building a reputation. Every brand link
                      helps to bolster your brand recognition and
                      trust. And Google knows that people like
                      dealing with brands they can trust.

                    <p>
                      The way your brand looks online directly impacts
                      your sales. Customers remember the things they
                      read about your brand and use it to inform their
                      purchase decisions. That’s why being in control
                      of your SEO branding is so important. You want
                      to make sure only positive items show up in the
                      SERPs when customers search for your brand.

                    Don’t make the common mistake of underestimating branding and overestimating quick hacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sure, driving traffic is important. On-site optimization is important. Paid ads are important. But none of these are as important as your branding efforts. A solid Brand Links strategy supports all your other marketing efforts so that it’s easier to rank, drive sales, and ultimately boost profits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why is branding so important? Well, it all started back in 2008 when Google started really paying attention to Brand Trust signals. Someone at Google HQ figured out that people look for brands to sort out the SERP cesspool and find trustworthy content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That’s when they changed their algorithm to rank sites based on trust signals, and even filed a patent for it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ever since then, trust has been used as a crucial ranking factor for providing users with the best search results. If you want to appear in those search results for your target keywords, you need to look like a trustworthy brand, which makes brand optimization a vital part of SEO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So how do you convince Google that you’re a big brand? Easy, you build brand signals.
                    And that’s where our Brand Links package comes in.

                  <p>
                    Topical relevancy is central to your SEO branding strategy. Google builds up a picture of your brand based on the kind of keywords it associates with it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That’s why we start by writing rich, topically-relevant content to support your brand keywords. Our team of writers will research your brand and put together a company profile page that you can be proud of; one that reflects your core brand message. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We make sure to include all the important stuff, like up to date information on what services you promote, who started the business, your contact details, social media profiles, and what you want to be known for. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We’ll create 10 separate, unique versions of your company profile to make sure that there is no duplicate content and then post them on some of the most popular and authoritative branding sites for your niche.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, let’s say your niche is Bitcoin, we’ll create 10 great company profiles and set them up on the most popular branding sites. This will help you to establish yourself as a big brand and dominate the search results for Bitcoin.
